## Summary:
I developed the project for learning .Net core MVC structure working and local db communication without external sql server installation.
In this project I have followed 3 layer architecture where I have followed the coding standards and naming conventions.

For more learning about 3 layer architecture: <a>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-net-3-tier-architecture</a>

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the standard conventions of a .NET Core MVC application:

#### Controllers:
Contains the controller classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
#### Views: 
Contains the Razor view templates that define the HTML markup and UI logic for rendering the application's user interface.
#### Models: 
Contains the model classes that represent the data entities used by the application.
#### wwwroot: 
Contains static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
#### Startup.cs: 
Configures the application's services and middleware pipeline.

## Learning Objectives
This project aims to cover the following learning objectives:

1. Understanding the basics of the MVC architectural pattern and its implementation in .NET Core.
2. Creating controllers and actions to handle different types of requests.
3. Defining views using Razor syntax to generate dynamic HTML output.
4. Working with models and model binding to handle user input and data persistence.
5. Utilizing routing to map URLs to specific controller actions.
6. Implementing validation and error handling in the application.
7. Managing static files and integrating CSS and JavaScript libraries.
8. Incorporating database operations using Entity Framework Core.
9. Implementation of Dependancy Injection in .Net core application
10. Introduction to javascript, css, and bootstrap
11. Configuring environment specific appsetting/config file in startup.cs

Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with different concepts to enhance your understanding of .NET Core MVC.

Thank you for your interest in this .Net Core MVC Learning project.
